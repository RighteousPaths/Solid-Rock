      <p>“And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in
earth”– Matthew 28:18</p>

<p>Jesus was here talking about ability, privilege, force, capacity, competency, freedom, mastery, and<br>
control, among other things that the Father has delegated to him. And Mark 16:17, he said, “And these
signs shall follow them that believe…….”  He then continues, “In my name shall they……” and
lists a lot of things that can be done by anyone who believes in him. Thus the power talked about gives
one the ability to create and also to change things. </p>

<p>Nowhere does the Word say “In numbers shall they……” and so for anyone to use numbers in an attempt
to show a person’s character, purpose in life, what motivates, and where talents may lie must be living in
deceit. Such people claim the use of numbers -numerology -helps determine the best time for major
moves and activities in life -when to invest, when to marry, when to travel, when to change jobs, or
relocate. </p>

<p>God frowns on this practice. It rather enslaves, wearies the victims, puts them in trouble, anguish, dark
despair, and burdens them with shame. Isaiah 47: 11 warns, “disaster will overtake…..”, “calamity
will fall…..”, and “catastrophe will strike ….suddenly.”  This shouldn’t be you! Numerology can’t
save you. Get out of it this numbers-driven life right now!</p>

<p>The truth is that it is in Christ that one dies to this life; it’s no longer you who now lives but Christ who lives in you. Colossians 3:3, 4 say, “your real life is hidden with Christ in God” and therefore Christ is your life.”  Paul says severally in the Gospels about that power in Christ:  “And because you belong to him, the power of the life-giving Spirit has freed you from the power of sin that leads to death” Romans 8:2), 1Corinthians 15:10 says, “………yet it was not I but God who was working
through me by his grace”, 2Corinthians 6:7 states: “God’s power is working in us. We use the
weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense” while
Philippians 1:6 says, “….that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his
work……”</p>

<p>This power in Christ becomes yours on believing that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and
that he was raised from the dead on the third day for your justification unto a new life. This you
endorse, accept, and confess Jesus as your Savior and the Lord of your life. </p>

<p>With this you would have received God’s Spirit, not the world’s spirit, so you can know the wonderful
things God has freely given you. It’s not arithmetic calculations or the use of words that come from
human wisdom but rather the affirmation of what the Holy Spirit teaches you from the Word of God.</p>

<p>It’s with those words that you construct, create, shape, and chart the quality of your life here on
earth. Numerology can’t do this! Your words also will determine the quality of relationship with God
and fellow men as well as where you end eternally. </p>

<p>Romans 10:9, 10 (ASV) says, “…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt
believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: for with the heart
man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” </p>

<p>If you do, pray the prayer below and share this article with your family members, coworkers, customers
and clients, friends, and all those you relate with:</p>

<p>“O Lord God, I confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life, and believe in my heart that you
raised Him from the dead for my justification. Therefore in accordance with your Word, I
receive eternal life into my spirit, declaring that I’m a child of God now. Amen.”</p>

<p>Your new life in Christ has started. Colossians 3:16 says: “Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly
in all wisdom….”  (MKJV) Know more to enjoy more of what Christ has freely given you. </p>

<p>I gladly invite you to join any Christ Embassy Church nearest you.</p>
